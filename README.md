# 3D Product Configurator! :trollface:



Why pay thousands of dollars for Expivi, Threekit or SalesForce to give your customers the best experience? (monthly fees) 
Introducing Zimbabwes first no-cost, locally built 3D product configurator for apparel, built for Gutu Tich by Kudzai Richard Jaure. 

Making use of the latest web technologies such as three.js and Vite, this is a responsive, fluid and easy to use configurator, completely customizable from lighting, to presets, to interactability, to logo positioning and more.
